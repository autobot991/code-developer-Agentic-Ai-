## Overview

ðŸš€ Build an Agentic AI Debate App with Autogen 0.5 and Streamlit: A Step-by-Step Tutorial ðŸš€

Unlock the power of Agentic AI and learn how to create collaborating AI agents that code, execute, and automate real-world tasks â€” all from scratch! In this hands-on tutorial, we'll build two powerful agents: a Code Developer and a Code Executor, working together to complete coding challenges and generate real results. We will work with Autogen 0.5 which is the latest version of the framework.

## What you'll learn:

âœ… Understand the fundamentals of agentic AI and multi-agent collaboration in Autogen 0.5

âœ… Build a smart Code Developer Agent to write Python and Shell script code

âœ… Create a reliable Code Executor Agent to run and evaluate results

âœ… Implement exciting projects like:

â€ƒ- ðŸ§© Random Maze Generation & Solving

â€ƒ- ðŸª™ 1,000 Coin Toss Simulation with Visuals

âœ… Build an interactive, user-friendly Streamlit UI (web application) for real-time outputs

## Who should watch?
Anyone who knows a little bit of Python.

##  Getting Started
1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -U "autogen-agentchat"
   pip install "autogen-ext[openai]"
   pip install "autogen-ext[docker]"
   ```

2. Insert your OpenAI API key as `api.txt` file in the same directory as the script. The file should contain only the API key, without any additional text or formatting.

3. Run the `app.py` script:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Enjoy :)
